AI Model Deployment: Integrate ML models for predictions (crop disease outbreaks, optimal harvest times, resource allocation) with live model serving.

User Authentication & Personalization: Allow personalized dashboards, custom reports, and secure role-based access.

Advanced Geospatial Visualization: Implement interactive maps (Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS) with custom data layers for powerful location-based insights.

Comprehensive Backend Infrastructure: Build a production-ready backend (Flask, Django, Node.js, Go) for data ingestion, processing, storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), APIs, and user interactions.

Monetization Strategy: Research and implement subscription tiers, premium data access, specialized consulting, or custom solutions for clients.

IoT and Sensor Network Integration: Integrate environmental sensors and IoT devices for granular real-time data.

Mobile Responsiveness: Further optimize the design and interactivity for flawless experience on mobile devices.
